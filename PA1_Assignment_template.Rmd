## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Loading and preprocessing the data
==================================

1. Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

```{r activity}
activityData <- read.csv('activity.csv')
dat = read.csv('activity.csv', header = T)
names(dat)
str(dat)
head(dat)
```
2. Histogram, Mean & Median

I will make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and I will summarize the data by day:

```{r hist}
totalSteps <- tapply(dat$steps, dat$date, sum, na.rm = T)
avgSteps <- tapply(dat$steps, dat$date, mean, na.rm = T)
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(totalSteps, breaks = 10, col = "red", main = "Distribution of the total Number of steps each day", 
    xlab = "Average Total Number of Steps")
hist(as.vector(avgSteps), breaks = 10, col = "blue", main = "Distribution of the Average Number of steps each day", 
    xlab = "Average Number of Steps")
```

3. Average daily activity pattern

# Find the average number of steps grouped by intereval

```{r steps}
Steps = tapply(dat$steps, dat$interval, mean, na.rm = T)
```
# Convert levels of intervals into numeric

Interval <- as.numeric(l)

# Create the dataframe df of the Interval and Steps columns

df <- data.frame(Steps, Interval)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

g <- ggplot(df, aes(Interval, Steps))
g + geom_line(colour = "blue") + ggtitle("Time Series Plot of the 5-minute Interval\n and the Average Number of Steps,\n Taken across all Days") + 
    ylab("Average Number of Steps")

Imputing missing values

# Missing data
```{r}
missing <- is.na(dat)
```
# Number of missing values

```{r}
(n.missing <- sum(missing))
```
## [1] 2304

# Impute data using the mice (multivariate imputation chains equation)
library(mice)

## Loading required package: Rcpp

## mice 2.21 2014-02-05

# Impute by replacing NA by the mean of steps

```{r steps3}
dat$steps[is.na(dat$steps)] <- tapply(dat$steps, 
    dat$interval, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

# Number of total steps each day
# Summary statistics before and after imputing

```{r}
totStepsImp <- tapply(dat$steps, dat$date, sum)
summary(totalSteps)
```
from my findings, there is seem to be not a significant difference in the average number of total steps each day before and after imputing data.

# Compare total number of steps each day before and after imputing

```{r hist4}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
hist(totalSteps, col = "red", xlab = "Average Total Number of Steps Before Imputing", 
    main = "", breaks = 10)
title("Distribution of the total Number of steps\n each day Before and After Imputing")
hist(totStepsImp, col = "cyan", main = "", xlab = "Average Total Number of Steps After Imputing", 
    breaks = 10)
```

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

# Extract weekdays

```{r}
dat$Days <- weekdays(as.Date(as.character(dat$date)))
```
# Create a logical vector d where Days are Saturday or Sunday
```{r}
d <- dat$Days == "Saturday" | dat$Days == "Sunday"
```

# Call Saturday and Sunday Weekend
```{r}
dat$Days[d] = "Weekend"
```
# Call weekdays (Monday through Friday) Weekdays

```{r}
dat$Days[!d] = "Weekday"
```

# Weekdays
```{r}
datWD <- dat[dat$Days == "Weekday", ]
```

# Weekend
```{r}
datWE <- dat[dat$Days == "Weekend", ]
```
# Convert levels of interval into numeric for weekdays
```{r}
IntervalWD <- as.numeric(levels(as.factor(datWD$interval)))
```
# Convert levels of interval into numeric for the weekend
```{r}
IntervalWE <- as.numeric(levels(as.factor(datWE$interval)))
```

# Average number of steps during weekdays
```{r}
avgWD <- tapply(datWD$steps, datWD$interval, mean)
```
# Average number of steps during the weekend

```{r}
avgWE <- tapply(datWE$steps, datWE$interval, mean)
```

# Data frame combining average number of steps and interval during weekdays

```{r}
dfWD <- data.frame(avgWD, IntervalWD)
```
# Data frame combining average number of steps and interval during the
# weekend

```{r}
dfWE <- data.frame(avgWE, IntervalWE)
```
Convert Days into factor dat$Days <- as.factor(dat$Days)
dat$interval <- factor(dat$interval)

```{r plot5}
plot(dfWD$IntervalWD, dfWD$avgWD, type = "l", main = "Comparison of the Average Number of Steps\n between Weekdays and the Weekend", 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of Steps")
lines(dfWE$IntervalWE, dfWE$avgWE, col = "red")
legend("topright", c("Weekday", "Weekend"), col = c("black", "red"), lty = 1)
```

# Add a column to the data frames that include weekdays and weekend days
```{r}
dfWD$wDays <- rep("Weekday", nrow(dfWD))
dfWE$wDays <- rep("Weekend", nrow(dfWD))
```

# Rename column names to match
```{r}
colnames(dfWD) <- c("Steps", "Interval", "wDays")
colnames(dfWE) <- c("Steps", "Interval", "wDays")
```

# rbind the dataframes

```{r}
df <- rbind(dfWD, dfWE)
```

# Convert wDays column into a factor
```{r}
df$wDays <- factor(df$wDays)
```
```{r}
library(lattice)
```

# Use lattice library to plot
```{r}
xyplot(Steps ~ Interval | wDays, data = df, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), ylab = "Average Number of Steps")
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

# Using ggplot2 package
```{r plot7}
g <- ggplot(df, aes(Interval, Steps, fill = wDays, colour = wDays))
g + geom_line() + labs(colour = "") + ggtitle("Comparison of the Average Number of Steps\n between Weekdays and Weekend") + 
    ylab("Average Number of Steps")
```
